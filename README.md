Creation of a form for a race registration where I ask for data like full, name, e-mail and password. 


In this project called “Race registration,” I could implement new HTML elements like:
*	Input (type radio, text, email, and password)
* Label
*	Button
*	Form
*	Section
*	Select
*	Option


In the style.css archive, I’ve chosen the RaleWay font as the principal font, adjusted the divisions to the center, applied the hover selector in the button, and made other basic adjustments.
For now, this form is going nowhere, I hope on implementing this soon.

Feel free to comment on this and suggest new features
